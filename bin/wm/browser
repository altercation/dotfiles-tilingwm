# In the case statement below, each statement entry does three possible things:
#
# 1) Assigns a debug PORT so that a separate url-actions script can send
#    commands to it. If no port is assigned, no debug commands may be sent.
#    Note that since each "cluster" of workspace names (or numbers) will
#    have an independent browser instance running, the port must be unique.
#    This introduces some complexity in that the url-actions script must
#    identify the current workspace in order to send commands to the browser.
#    Each case statement can either leave the CURRENTWS value as is or
#    optionally rename it. The difference being that if the case statement
#    is something like 3|art|music|code) and the CURRENTWS value is not changed
#    set in that case statement, then workspace #2 or workspaces with the
#    name of "art" or "music" or "code" would each get entirely different
#    browser profiles (and this may be desirable). Alternately, if you had a
#    case statement like 2|wkr|work) and you want them all to have the same
#    browser profile, then assign the CURRENTWS variable to something common
#    in that statement, such as:
#
#        2|wrk|work) CURRENTWS="wrk" ;;
#
# 2) Accepts the current value of "CURRENTWS" or assigns an empty value to it.
#    If the value is empty, then the browser runs as a "default profile", which
#    is the normal mode the browser would run in (and standard profile
#    directory). If CURRENTWS retains its initially assigned value (the name
#    or number of the workspace) then the browser instance will run in a
#    unique profile directory. This allows entirely separate configuration
#    for browser profiles, etc.
#
# 3) Sets incognito mode via a flag variable.
